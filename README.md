Task 1: Build an ESG document classifier

As a Data Scientist in a rating agency, your goal is to build an ESG document classifier that can take a document as an input, classify each page to be either E,S or G related. The business wants your approach to beat an existing baseline that results in 90% F-score, while having a strong 95% on environmental content

Files
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format with all the page ids on which you should provide a prediction
labels.csv - the labels to train your model
